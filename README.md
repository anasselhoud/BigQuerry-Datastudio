### Project 1: Descriptive Analysis of the top 2% Scientists in the world Dataset
The descriptive analysis I carried out was based on the top 2% scientists dataset published on October 2020 on Mendeley Research data. The report was prepared by Prof. John PA Loannidis of Stanford University and his team. You can check it from here (Updated science-wide author databases of standardized citation indicators).

I set the descriptive analysis using Big Query on Google Cloud Platform. All the visualization parts and the report are prepared using Data Studio. You can interact with the data by filtering the countries and selecting the research year range.

You can check the PDF file of the static report from here:
At the same time, and for a better user experience, I recommend you to check the interactive version directly from here:
